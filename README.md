## Project Title
Microsoft Excel Project

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project was to clean and organize raw data using Microsoft Excel to make it analysis-ready. This includes correcting formatting issues, removing unnecessary or duplicate entries, and ensuring consistency across the dataset to allow for accurate insights during further analysis.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

## Data Overview
The dataset consisted of customer transaction records including columns like Name, Region, Product, Quantity, and Price per Unit.
 

## Data Cleaning Steps Performed:
1.	Trimmed Extra Spaces:
o	Used the TRIM() function to remove leading, trailing, and multiple spaces in text fields in the “Names” column.
2.	Corrected Inconsistent Formatting:
o	Unified inconsistent spacing and capitalization.
o	Adjusted numerical formatting for currency and date fields.
3.	Removed Duplicates:
o	Applied Excel’s Remove Duplicates tool across selected columns to eliminate redundant records.
4.	Handled Missing or Invalid Values:
o	Reviewed for blank and placeholder values such as inf and replaced them with “N/A” and 0 in the Region and Price Per Unit Columns respectively, using the find and replace tool (Ctrl+ H).

## Final Outcome: cleaned dataset
•	The dataset was successfully cleaned and structured in a consistent and analysis-friendly format.
•	The refined version can now be used in further analytical tools such as Power BI or Python for deeper insights.
